# Overview
This repo. contains notes and projects from the CMU10-715 class. I took this class as independant learning (I was not enrolled). This course is part of a series of PhD level courses I have / will take as part of independant learning. The original series of courses was inspired by the reddit thread [Phd-level courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/51qhc8/phdlevel_courses/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)
